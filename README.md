# Calculator

Model of a calculator in Unreal Engine 5.3.2 as an Actor. You can instantiate the Actor, click on the buttons and see the result.

You can try this project e.g. by following steps:

-download and unzip files

-right click on Calculator.uproject -> Generate Visual Studio project files

-open Calculator.sln in Visual Studio

-run


The Project contains one C++ Actor 'CalcCore' to process the calculations. There are also a few Blueprint assets to manage the visual part. There are a few calculators already in the level, but you can add more by instantiating the 'CalcBody' asset.

You can also watch the project in this video:
